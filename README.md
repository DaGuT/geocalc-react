This project is done using my other work at https://github.com/DaGuT/my-site

It's used to simplify work of geodesists by providing friendly UI to solve complex mathematical problems (code for math problems is not included as I was not allowed to share it).

It's written with react and is adaptive so that people can use it while in fields. It's module based, so if other people would want to add more problems, it will be easy to do using the same principle as used in https://github.com/DaGuT/geocalc-react/blob/master/src/app/pages/index/parts/calculator-tabs/1.Uglovaya.js

Demo is available here http://geocalc.am.tpu.ru/

Regi's solver is not included, so you will have to (re)implement your own.
No more info, just good luck :D
